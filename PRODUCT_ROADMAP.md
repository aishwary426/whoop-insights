## 🎯 **Strategic Priorities (Product Manager View)**

### **1. Engagement > Features**
**Focus on making existing features more discoverable and actionable, rather than adding new ones.**

- Add tooltips explaining what each metric means
- Add "Why this matters" explanations
- Add action buttons: "What should I do about this?"
- Improve onboarding to show value immediately

### **2. Notifications = Retention**
**Notifications are the #1 driver of daily engagement. This should be your top priority.**

- Build notification system first
- Make notifications valuable (not spammy)
- Allow granular control
- Track notification effectiveness

### **3. Habit Insights = Differentiation**
**This is what makes you different from WHOOP. WHOOP shows data; you show causation.**

- Make habit impact scoring prominent
- Show statistical confidence
- Visualize correlations clearly
- Make it shareable ("I learned alcohol hurts my recovery by 15%")

### **4. Mobile-First = Growth**
**Most users check recovery on their phone. Desktop-only limits growth.**

- Optimize for mobile
- Add PWA capabilities
- Make key actions one-tap
- Ensure fast load times

---

## 🚫 **What NOT to Build Next**

### **Skip These (For Now):**
1. **Social Features** (teams, leaderboards) - Low priority, high effort
2. **Integrations** (Strava, TrainingPeaks) - Nice to have, but not core value
3. **Gamification** (badges, points) - Doesn't align with serious athlete persona
4. **AR/VR Visualizations** - Too early, low ROI
5. **AI Chat Assistant** - Complex, can add later

**Why:** Focus on core value delivery first. These features are distractions from the main goal: helping users optimize training and recovery.

## 🎯 **The "North Star" Metric**

**Primary Goal:** **70% 30-day user retention**

Everything should be measured against this. If a feature doesn't help retention, deprioritize it.

**How to achieve:**
1. Notifications drive daily engagement → retention
2. Habit insights create "aha moments" → retention
3. Mobile access makes it convenient → retention
4. Actionable recommendations build trust → retention

---

## 💡 **Product Manager Insights**

### **What Makes This Product Special:**
1. **Local-first privacy** - Users own their data
2. **ML personalization** - Not generic advice, but personalized insights
3. **Actionable insights** - Not just data, but recommendations
4. **Causation, not correlation** - Habit impact scoring shows what actually matters

### **Key Differentiators:**
- WHOOP shows data → You show insights
- WHOOP is backward-looking → You are forward-looking (forecasts)
- WHOOP is generic → You are personalized
- WHOOP is passive → You are proactive (notifications, alerts)

### **User Journey:**
1. **Upload data** → See immediate value (recovery forecast)
2. **Use for 1 week** → Discover habit impacts ("alcohol hurts my recovery!")
3. **Get notifications** → Daily engagement
4. **See progress** → Baseline improvements → Long-term retention
5. **Share insights** → Word of mouth growth

---

## 🚀 **Final Recommendation**

**Start with Sprint 1 (Notifications + Habit Insights + Anomaly Detection).**

These three features will:
- ✅ Drive daily engagement (notifications)
- ✅ Create "aha moments" (habit insights)
- ✅ Build trust (anomaly detection)

**Then measure. Then iterate.**

Don't build features in a vacuum. Ship, measure, learn, improve.
